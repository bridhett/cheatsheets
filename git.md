# git reference

`git init`: starts a new git repo on your local machine.
(not neccessary if you used create-react-app)

Make a new repo on Github.com, so you can copy the URL: 
`git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REP.git`

### pushing to git

`git add .`: adds all files in current folder.

`git commit -m "message`: commits!

`git push origin master`: push to github.com!

### pulling from git

`git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REP.git`: clone a repo.\
***make sure to be in the folder you want the repo in.**

`git pull origin master`: pulls new changes committed from git.

### notes:

`gitignore`: this file lets you set which files and folders are ignored by git.
(not neccessary if you used create-react-app, it does it for you)
